# Ever Muniz // Professional Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio for potential employers to learn about me, my work, and how to contact me. Throughout the coding bootcamp I'll have the opportunity to update my portfolio with new content. 

Building this website from scratch helped solidify HTML and CSS concepts for me. Things such as flex box, pseudo-elements, and styling.
